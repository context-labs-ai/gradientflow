## Frontend guidelines
- Animations: smooth but snappy; avoid overly long or distracting transitions.
- UI: minimalist style with high-quality visual details (subtle shadows, gradients, and hover states).
- Layout: keep structure simple, but invest in polished micro-interactions and spacing.

## Backend guidelines
- Design features to be LLM-friendly (clear APIs, well-structured JSON responses, and stable contracts).
- Keep the chat room logic friendly to LLM bots (predictable message shapes, metadata for tools, etc.).

## Code
- Maintain a clear folder structure and modular code (small, focused functions/modules).
- Keep the architecture extensible for future upgrades and integrations.
